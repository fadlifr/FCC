				<p>
					To build websites, you should know about
					<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>
					â€” the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to
					specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link,
					image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new
					element that you define.
				</p>

				<p>
					Ideally, you should start your learning journey by learning HTML. Start by reading
					<a
						href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction"
						target="_blank"
						>Introduction to HTML</a
					>. You may move on to learning about more advanced topics such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>,
						and how to use it to style HTML (for example alter your text size and fonts used, add
						borders and drop shadows, layout your page with multiple columns, add animations and
						other visual effects.)
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript" target="_blank"
							>JavaScript</a
						>, and how to use it to add dynamic functionality to web pages (for example find your
						location and plot it on a map, make UI elements appear/disappear when you toggle a
						button, save users' data locally on their computers, and much much more.)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Before starting this topic, you should have at least basic familiarity with using
					computers and using the web passively (i.e. just looking at it, consuming the content. You
					should have a basic work environment set up as detailed in
					<a
						href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software"
						target="_blank"
						>Installing basic software</a

					are parts of our

						target="_blank"
						>Getting started with the web</a
					>complete beginner's module.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is recommended that you work through
					<a
						href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web"
						target="_blank"
						>Getting started with the web</a
					>before attempting this topic, however, it isn't absolutely necessary; much of what is
					covered in the HTML basics article is also covered in our Introduction to HTML module,
					albeit in a lot more detail.

				<p>
					This topic contains the following modules, in a suggested order for working through them.
					You should definitely start with the first one.
				</p>
				<h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
				<p>
					HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web page.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
					<li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
					<li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
					<li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>
					<li>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</li>
					<li>
						HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading","this is a paragraph",
						"this is a link", etc.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Anatomy of an HTML document</h4>
				<pre><code>
			&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
			&lt;html&gt;
				&lt;head&gt;
					&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
					&lt;title&gt;Title Page&lt;/title&gt;
				&lt;/head&gt;
				&lt;body&gt;
					&lt;h1&gt;First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;/body&gt;
			&lt;/html&gt;
			</code></pre>
				<p>Here we have:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></code
						>: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to
						a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More
						recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything
						else to work right.
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></code> is the shortest
						string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!
					</li>
					<li>
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span></code
						>: The <code><span class="code-sample">&lt;html&gt</span></code> element. This elemen
						wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span></code
						>: The <code><span class="code-sample">&lt;head&gt;</span></code> element. This element
						acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page,
						<strong>that isn't the content</strong> the page will show to viewers. This includes
						keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS style content,
						characterset declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article of
						the series.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span></code
						>: This element specifies the character set for your dodument to UTF-8, which includes
						most characters from the vast majority of human written languages.With this setting,the
						page can now handle any textual content it might containt. There is no reason not to set
						this, it can help avoid some problems later.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span></code
						>: The <code><span class="code-sample">&lt;title&gt;</span></code> element. This sets
						the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is
						loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.
					</li>
					<li>
						<code><span class="code-sample">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span></code
						>: The <code><span class="code-sample">&lt;body&gt;</span></code> element. This contains
						<em>all</em> the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos,
						games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Multimedia and embedding</h3>
				<p>
					This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including
					the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even
					entire other webpages.
				</p>
				<h3>HTML tables</h3>
				<p>
					Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a
					challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as
					implementing captions and summaries.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="Solving_common_HTML_problems">
				<header>Solving common HTML problems</header>
				<p>
					Use HTML to solve common problems provides links to sections of content explaining how to
					use HTML to solve very common problems when creating a webpage: dealing with titles,
					adding images or videos, emphasizing content, creating a basic form, etc.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="main-section" id="See_also">
				<header>See also</header>
				<h3>Web forms</h3>
				<p>
					This module provides a series of articles that will help you master the essentials of web
					forms. Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they
					are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface.
					However, for historical and technical reasons it's not always obvious how to use them to
					their full potential. We'll cover all the essential aspects of Web forms including marking
					up their HTML structure, styling form controls, validating form data, and submitting data
					to the server.
				</p>
				<h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
				<p>
					The main entry point for HTML reference documentation on MDN, including detailed element
					and attribute references â€” if you want to know what attributes an element has or what
					values an attribute has, for example, this is a great place to start.
				</p>

				<header>References</header>
				<p>All the documentation in this page is taken from:</p>
				<ul>
